 Weather App Sprint Day 5

 // Brief Description of what you did. 
    I replicated a weather app figma that fetches data from  openweather api and displays the data on the website my app has a favorites list and the user can delete items from the favorites list. i also implimented local storage so if the user returns back to the page the data will resume where the user left off.
